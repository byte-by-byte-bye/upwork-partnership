## Upwork Partnership Opportunity

### Concept

I’m looking for a reliable partner (no need to be a developer) for a long-term collaboration by Upwork renting. <br>
You provide access to an account in your name, and I take care of all the work and client communication. <br>
Earnings go directly to you, and you just send me my share—so there’ll be no risk on your side.

**You’ll earn $100–$200 monthly without much effort (or a negotiable percentage that can increase over time).**

If you’re interested, I’ll explain everything step by step so you feel completely comfortable before starting
